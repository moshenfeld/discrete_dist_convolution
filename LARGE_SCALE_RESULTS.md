# Large-Scale Performance Results

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Implementation**: PMF√óPMF Convolution Kernel (Numba-optimized)

## ‚úÖ Performance at Scale

The PMF√óPMF kernel has been tested at realistic scales with **thousands to tens of thousands of bins**, demonstrating excellent performance for tight numerical evaluations.

### Benchmark Results

| Grid Size | Operations | Time | Throughput | Mass Conservation |
|-----------|------------|------|------------|-------------------|
| 1k √ó 1k   | 1M         | 24 ms | 42.3 M ops/sec | 1.0000000000 |
| 5k √ó 5k   | 25M        | 906 ms | 27.6 M ops/sec | 1.0000000000 |
| 10k √ó 5k  | 50M        | 1.95 s | 25.6 M ops/sec | 1.0000000000 |
| 20k √ó 20k | 400M       | 17.5 s | 22.9 M ops/sec | 1.0000000000 |

**Key Observations:**
- ‚úÖ Perfect mass conservation at all scales (10 decimal places)
- ‚úÖ Consistent throughput: ~25-40 million operations/second
- ‚úÖ Numba JIT compilation overhead: ~1-2 warmup runs
- ‚úÖ Smooth, accurate distributions at high resolution

### Test Coverage

**Grid Resolutions Tested:**
- 1,000 bins: Fast prototyping and testing
- 5,000 bins: High-resolution practical use
- 10,000 bins: Very fine-grained distributions
- 20,000 bins: Ultra-high resolution for tight bounds

**Distribution Types:**
- Gaussian (standard and shifted)
- Exponential (various rates)
- Uniform (baseline)

### Numerical Accuracy

All tests maintain perfect probability conservation:
```
Total mass = sum(PMF) + p_neg_inf + p_pos_inf = 1.0000000000
```

No significant numerical errors observed even at 20k bins.

## üéØ Suitability for Tight Evaluations

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Handles 10,000+ bins efficiently
- ‚úÖ O(mn) complexity scales predictably
- ‚úÖ Numba optimization provides 20-40M ops/sec
- ‚úÖ Perfect mass conservation (no numerical drift)
- ‚úÖ Proper handling of tie-breaking modes
- ‚úÖ Infinity mass accounting when needed

**Current Limitations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only PMF√óPMF implemented (CDF/CCDF kernels are stubs)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot yet compute envelope bounds
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Self-convolution not yet implemented

**For Your Use Case (tight evaluations with thousands of bins):**
- **PMF√óPMF convolution**: ‚úÖ Ready for production use
- **Envelope bounds (CDF/CCDF)**: ‚ùå Requires implementation of Phases 2-4

## üîß Running Large-Scale Tests

```bash
# Quick demonstration (small grids)
python experiments/demo_pmf_pmf.py

# Large-scale performance test (1k-20k bins)
python experiments/demo_pmf_pmf_large_scale.py

# Run all tests including large-scale
pytest tests/ -v
```

## üí° Next Steps for Complete Functionality

To enable tight envelope bounds with high-resolution grids:

1. **Implement PMF√óCDF Stieltjes kernel** (Phase 2)
   - Required for CDF lower/upper bounds
   - ~500 lines of code following implementation guide

2. **Implement PMF√óCCDF Stieltjes kernel** (Phase 3)
   - Required for CCDF lower/upper bounds
   - Similar structure to PMF√óCDF

3. **Implement self-convolution** (Phase 4)
   - Uses exponentiation-by-squaring
   - Enables X+X+...+X (T times) efficiently

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days for experienced developer following the detailed implementation guides in `docs/`.

---

**Conclusion:** The PMF√óPMF kernel is production-ready for high-resolution convolutions. For complete envelope functionality at scale, Phases 2-4 need implementation.
